| Metric | Poetry | uv |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Daily time saved | Baseline | +15-25 min |
| Onboarding friction | Moderate | Low |
| Context switching | High | Minimal |
| Build reliability | Good | Excellent |

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Poetry When:

**Complete project lifecycle management needed:**
- Building and publishing packages to PyPI
- Complex dependency group management (dev, test, docs)
- Team needs integrated project scaffolding
- Publishing libraries or frameworks

**Example projects:**
```bash
# Python library development
poetry new my-awesome-library
poetry add requests typer
poetry add pytest black mypy --group dev
poetry build && poetry publish
```

**Mature workflow requirements:**
- Established Poetry-based CI/CD pipelines
- Team familiar with Poetry conventions  
- Complex build system integration needs

### Choose uv When:

**Performance is critical:**
- Large projects with 100+ dependencies
- Frequent dependency updates
- CI/CD pipeline optimization priority
- Developer productivity maximization

**Example projects:**
```bash
# High-performance application development
uv venv && uv add fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy
# 10x faster than poetry equivalent
```

**pip-compatible workflows:**
- Migrating from pip/pip-tools
- Integration with existing requirements.txt workflows
- Corporate environments with pip tooling

**Resource-constrained environments:**
- Docker containers (smaller image size)
- CI/CD with limited compute quotas
- Development on lower-spec machines

## Migration Strategies

### Poetry ‚Üí uv Migration

**1. Dependency extraction:**
```bash
# Export Poetry dependencies
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
poetry export -f requirements.txt --dev --output requirements-dev.txt

# Import to uv
uv add -r requirements.txt
uv add -r requirements-dev.txt --dev
```

**2. Lock file migration:**
```bash
# Generate new lock file with uv
uv lock

# Verify compatibility
uv sync && python -m pytest
```

### Hybrid Approach

**Development with uv, publishing with Poetry:**
```bash
# Fast development iteration
uv add requests pandas

# Publishing preparation
poetry init
poetry add requests pandas
poetry build && poetry publish
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

### uv Optimization
```bash
# Enable parallel downloads
export UV_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=10

# Use system trust store for corporate networks
export UV_SYSTEM_CERTS=1

# Cache optimization
export UV_CACHE_DIR=/fast/ssd/path
```

### Poetry Optimization
```bash
# Faster dependency resolution
poetry config experimental.new-installer true

# Parallel installation
poetry config installer.max-workers 10

# Cache configuration
poetry config cache-dir /fast/ssd/path
```

## Conclusion

**Performance winner:** uv dominates in speed, memory usage, and resource efficiency with 8-15x improvements across most operations.

**Feature winner:** Poetry provides complete project lifecycle management with superior tooling for package development and publishing.

**Recommendation approach:**
- **New Python applications:** Start with uv for development speed
- **Python libraries:** Use Poetry for complete packaging workflow
- **Large teams:** Consider uv for CI/CD performance gains
- **Migration projects:** Evaluate based on existing toolchain complexity

The choice depends on whether raw performance or comprehensive project management features take priority for your specific use case.
